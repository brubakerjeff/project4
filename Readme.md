The robot will localizate itself with AMCL using the map that had been generated by SLAM . 
The robot will then navigate to a virtual marker at the specified pick up localization, which will then disappear and re-appear at the drop off zone. The robot will then follow to the drop off zone

## Mapping
 Mapping was  done with the SLAM algorithm. This map was saved previosuly and made available for this proect

``` rosrun map_server map_saver -f map ```

## Navigation 
## Localization
Localization is done with adapative monte carlo. A particle filter is used to represent the distribution of possible robot poses and converges to the correct location. It was important to specify a reasonable initial position so it could locate itself.
