For the complete project 
The robot will localizate itself with AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo) using the map that had been generated by SLAM (Simulteanous Localization and Mapping). 
First, the robot will then navigate to a virtual marker at the specified pick up localization as controlled by the pick object nodes.
The marker will appear based upon location from the add marker node. This simulates the robot carrying the marker. The robot will then go to the drop off zone as specified in pick_boject and the marker will re-appear.



## Mapping
 Mapping was  done with the SLAM algorithm. This map was saved previosuly and made available for this proect

``` rosrun map_server map_saver -f map ```

## Navigation 
## Localization
Localization is done with adapative monte carlo. A particle filter is used to represent the distribution of possible robot poses and converges to the correct location. It was important to specify a reasonable initial position so it could locate itself.
